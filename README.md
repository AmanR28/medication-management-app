## Design inspiration
- [Task Manager/calender App by Kawsar Ahmed for CLAW](https://dribbble.com/shots/16764078-Task-Manager-calender-App)
- [Calendar for scheduling consultations by UGEM](https://dribbble.com/shots/14376775-Calendar-for-scheduling-consultations)

You can take inspiration from the above design but it's not concrete that you have to build the exact page. Since the functionalities are different you will need to make an appt. change to the page accordingly. You need to keep the look and feel of the design in mind while making the changes.
